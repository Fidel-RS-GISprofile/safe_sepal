MODULE FOR SAFE INSIDE SEPAL
=====

[SAFE](http://www.fao.org/resilience/resources/resources-detail/en/c/1154965/) or Safe Access to Fuel and Energy is an initiative of the Food and Agriculture organisation of the United Nations (FAO) to address energy needs during emergencies and protracted crises, and to build resilient livelihoods in a sustainable manner.

[SEPAL](http://www.openforis.org/tools/sepal.html) is a cloud computing platform for geographical data processing. It enables users to quickly process large amount of data without high network bandwidth requirements or need to invest in high-performance computing infrastructure.
It is part of the [Open Foris](http://www.openforis.org/) initiative from the Forestry Department of the FAO. It is a set of free and open-source software tools that facilitates flexible and efficient data collection, analysis and reporting for the environment and more specifically for forests.

Background
----------

There were 70.8 million people forcibly displaced worldwide at the end of 2018 according to the [UNHCR](https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html), the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It is a complex problem to rapidly select suitable sites for diplacement settings in a host country.
There is thus a considerable need to have a more a systematic approach towards a flexible and adjustable open-source tool.

Even if each country is different, there are some common needs and well-being threshold that are shared by the [UNHCR](https://emergency.unhcr.org/) and the [Sphere movement](https://www.spherestandards.org/handbook-2018/).
This project was created to answer to this problem hoping it will help increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises.

Some background elements
----------
The scripts you will find on this platform will enable you to download OpenStreetMap [data](http://download.geofabrik.de/) rapidly for your area of interest(AOI) and get a first idea of geographic features of the landscape.
