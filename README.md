SEPAL is a cloud computing platform for geographical data processing. It enables users to quickly process large amount of data without high network bandwidth requirements or need to invest in high-performance computing infrastructure.

Background

There were 70.8 million people forcibly displaced worldwide at the end of 2018.
It is a complex problem to rapidly select suitable sites for diplacement settings in a host country.
There is thus a considerable need to have a more a systematic approach towards a flexible and adjustable open-source tool.

Even if each country is different, there are some common needs and well-being threshold that are shared by the UNHCR, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
This project was created to answer to this problem hoping it will help increase the resilience of livelihoods to threats and crises.
